# VERSION HISTORY
# ===============

Version 

	0.02b - 2022-04 - Minor updates, addition of new script: attack_cstats.sh which breaks
                          down blocked attacks by Class C IP instead of full IP - more useful
                          for lumping certain hostile web spiders together
        0.01b - 2022-03 - Initial public committed version
	0.02b - 2023-03 - working version - now having been tested for at least a year

 NOTE: This system has been in active use now for several years.  It's finally being
       publicly released. I have not run into legitimate users being affected by
       this blacklist but you might, if you do, please report any IP space that 
       should be removed here: https://github.com/DPsystems/web-shield/issues


# DEVELOPER NOTES
# ===============

Right now this system is not persistant/permanent.  There are a bunch of features I'd like to 
add to make this more flexible.  Here are future to-do items:

* figure where the standard place to install persistent files should be across all platforms
  (or actually make a real installation script)

* create a host-specific configuration file that will save special changes/exceptions so that
  when the base version is updated, it can inherit local configuration details (like certain
  IP space you want to exempt from the blacklist, and other settings.

* create a system to make the blacklist persistent across reboots - either make it part of
  a persistent IPTABLES/IPSET configuration, or add commands to reset the blacklist when the system
  reboots?

* add additional/optional blacklists - eventually perhaps a more restrictive blacklist of rogue
  IP space that should be blocked on http/s ports as well?

* hear from the community, ways in which this can be improved
