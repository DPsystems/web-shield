Your first line of WEB defense against Internet bots, hacks and probes.

A great stand alone filter, or compliment to the wonderful active 
firewall: WebShield, Fail2Ban, that will make F2B even more efficient.

# WHAT?
# =====

Web-Shield is a set of scripts that implements a traffic filter 
of your web server ports.

You may ask yourself, why and how should I bother filtering traffic
to my web sites?  I want as much traffic as possible, right?

Well, no, not really.  There are a lot of traffic that just wastes
bandwidth and exploits your system and content, and actively tries
to find vulnerabilities and ways into your system.  You do NOT 
want that.

Our blacklist is intended to be a "wide sweep" IPv4-based blacklist
of major groups of Internet locations that are notorious for housing
the lion's share of nefarious HOSTING OPERATIONS that 99.9% of the time
have NO BUSINESS WHATSOEVER crawling your web site.

In addition to this, there are some optional blacklists that are a 
little more aggressive in filtering common spiders and userspace that
is filled with fraud and activity that is unlikely to be of benefit.

This system can by used by itself or (ideally) in association with
more precise anti-hacking systems like Fail2Ban.  With this large
net in place, it reduces the resources Fail2Ban needs to only dealing
with mostly local attacks from IP space you might not want to ban
wholesale.

# WHY?
# ====

Every time a site is compromised, there's a chance lists of usernames
and passwords are leaked.  Hackers will take these lists and try to
find other systems that use these same credentials. If they can gain
access they can completely ruin your day (or year).  They will often
try to login to e-mail clients, ftp accounts, ssh services, etc.  
These system probes are now becoming even more sophisticated, and able
to recognize Fail2Ban trigger conditions and work around them.  Our
system stops approximately 90% of the attacks on most servers.

# HOW?
# ====

Web-shield is a very small set of IPTABLES rules that is designed
to block access primarily to web ports.
